## How We Built It? üõ†Ô∏è

To ensure scalability and a smooth user experience, the Quiz Maker app is built using:

- **Backend**: Node.js & Express.js for server-side logic and API handling.
- **Frontend**: React.js with TailwindCSS for a sleek and responsive UI.
- **Database**: MongoDB for storing quizzes, user data, and responses.
- **Authentication**: JWT-based authentication for secure user login and sign-up.
- **Deployment**: The frontend is hosted on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/), and the backend is deployed using [Render](https://render.com/).

The app supports two types of users:

### **For Quiz Takers:**
- Sign up & log in securely.
- Browse available quizzes.
- Attempt quizzes and get real-time results.
- View detailed explanations for wrong answers.
- Track progress and scores.

### **For Quiz Creators:**
- Create quizzes with various question types (MCQ, True/False, Fill in the Blanks).
- Manage and update existing quizzes.
- View participant responses and scores.
- Share quizzes via unique links.

### **Application Folder:**

- Handles business logic like quiz creation and response validation.
- Processes and formats data for the UI.

### **Presentation Folder:**
- Contains reusable UI components for displaying quizzes.
- Handles the visual structure and user interactions.

This separation ensures clean, maintainable, and scalable code.
